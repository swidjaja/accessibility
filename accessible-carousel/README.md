# Simple Accessible Carousel

## About this POC

This POC demonstrates a simple carousel that I think is adequately accessible for Web uses. It is friendly for both mouse users, keyboard users, and reader users.

- Mouse users: they can scroll through the contents 
- Keyboard and reader users: they can navigate through the contents and use the previous/next button to go to next page of contents. When they use the next/previous button, the focus will be automatically set to the first visible item.

POC has only been tested on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers on Mac with VoiceOver reader.
