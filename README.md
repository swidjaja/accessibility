# Topics in Accessibility

## Intro
Hello! Welcome to my Github repo dedicated to one of my passions, Web/mobile accessibility.

I plan to have the following materials in this repository
- Experiments on topics in Web/mobile accessibility
- Readily used libraries/utils to enhance Web/mobile accessibility

Thank you for visiting my repo! I hope that you will find this repository to be useful for your quests to either learn more about Web/mobile accessibility or to find any useful libraries/utils. Contributions/critics/questions/praises are always welcomed!

A11y FTW!
